1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,844
Write the equation y equals one third

2
00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:07,410
X minus four in standard form.

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:11,410
The given equation is in slope intercept form.

4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:16,290
Remember that was Y equals MX plus B.

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:21,360
Standard form is ax plus by equals C.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,070
Step one: get rid of the fractions in the equation.

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,610
Multiply every term by three.

8
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:33,218
Three Y equals three times the quantity

9
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:36,040
of one third x minus four.

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,504
Step two: distribute and simplify

11
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:43,980
three Y equals X minus twelve.

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,448
Step three: bring the x term to

13
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:51,194
the same side as the y term.

14
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:54,450
Subtract x from both sides.

15
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:59,920
Three Y minus X equals X minus X minus twelve.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,343
Step four: simplify three y

17
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:07,510
minus X equals negative twelve.

18
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:09,860
Notice the y term is first.

19
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,690
Step five: write the equation so the x term is first.

20
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:20,120
Negative x plus three y equals negative twelve.

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,556
The problem is now that the

22
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:25,308
x is negative. In standard form

23
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:27,720
do not lead with a negative number.

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,812
Step six: multiply each term by negative one so

25
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:36,108
as not to lead with a negative. Negative one

26
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:39,996
times the quantity of negative x plus three y

27
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:43,316
equals negative twelve becomes x minus three

28
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:44,720
Y equals twelve.
