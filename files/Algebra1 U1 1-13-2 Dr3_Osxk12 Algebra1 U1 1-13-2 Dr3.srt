00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,812
When writing an equation from a table of values, you

2
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:08,370
need two things the y intercept and the slope.

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:11,818
Let's take a look at question six from the activity.

4
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:15,570
The y intercept is where x equals zero.

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,950
To find this, work backward.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,204
Since the pattern of the y value goes up by two,

7
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:27,610
subtract two to find the value when X equals zero.

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:32,170
When x equals zero, y also equals zero.

9
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:34,834
Now that the Y intercept is known,

10
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,130
it's time to find the slope.

11
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:39,776
Remember, slope is the change in

12
00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:42,352
y over the change in x.

13
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:44,432
Look at the table and find the

14
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,070
change in y and change in x.

15
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:50,176
Notice that the x values change by one.

16
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:52,500
The y values change by two.

17
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:56,320
So the slope is two over one or two.

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,572
Now put this all together to write

19
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:02,320
an equation in slope intercept form.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,780
Slope intercept form is y equals MX plus

21
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:11,650
B m is the slope, which is two.

22
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:15,156
B is the y intercept which is zero.

23
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:18,924
So the equation is y equals two x

24
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:23,036
plus zero, or y equals two x.

25
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:25,052
Now it's your turn to try to write

26
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:27,430
an equation from a table of values.
