Graphing a system of equations has

2
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:05,410
steps similar to graphing one equation.

3
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:08,290
Here is a system of two equations.

4
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:11,716
Y equals four x minus four and

5
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:14,900
Y equals negative two x plus eight.

6
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:17,460
First, find the slope and Y

7
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,482
intercept of the first equation.

8
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:23,620
The slope is four because that is the coefficient of x.

9
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:27,240
The Y intercept or B is negative four.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,316
Next, find the slope and Y

11
00:00:30,317 --> 00:00:32,753
intercept of the second equation.

12
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:35,116
The slope is negative two because

13
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:37,244
that is the coefficient of x.

14
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,348
The Y intercept or b is eight.

15
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:44,490
Graph both equations on the same coordinate plane.

16
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,890
Remember to first graph the Y intercept.

17
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:51,012
Then use the slope to find more points.

18
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:53,412
The first line is the purple line.

19
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,604
The second line is in black.

20
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:58,026
Identify the solution by finding

21
00:00:58,027 --> 00:01:00,458
where the two lines intersect.

22
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,840
They intersect at the point of 2,4.
